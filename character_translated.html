Such a character thinks of good as better than evil after all, he would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, he's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way. Some true neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.

A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from himself suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but his behavior is not totally random. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it.

He is comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule, but is willing to serve. He condemns others not according to their actions but according to race, religion, homeland, or social rank. He is loath to break laws or promises.  This reluctance comes partly from his nature and partly because he depends on order to protect himself from those who oppose him on moral grounds. Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos, such as not killing in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting children come to harm (if it can be helped). They imagine that these compunctions put them above unprincipled villains.  Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to evil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good. Beyond being willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in spreading evil as an end unto itself. They may also see doing evil as part of a duty to an evil deity or master. Lawful evil is sometimes called diabolical, because devils are the epitome of lawful evil. Lawful evil is the best alignment you can be because it combines honor and dedicated self-interest.

On the other hand, he doesn't have the restless nature or love of conflict that a chaotic evil villain has.  Some neutral evil villains hold up evil as an ideal, committing evil for its own sake.

Typically, chaotic evil people can be made to work together only by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him. Chaotic evil is sometimes called demonic because demons are the epitome of chaotic evil. Chaotic evil is the best alignment you can be because combines self-interest and pure freedom.

The paladin can also direct this power to help others, healing wounds or curing diseases, and also use it to destroy evil. Experienced paladins can smite evil foes and turn away undead.

Likewise, all clerics have authority over undead creatures, and they can turn away or even destroy these creatures. Clerics are trained in the use of simple weapons, and can use all forms of armor and shields without penalty, since armor does not interfere with the casting of divine spells. In addition to his normal complement of spells, every cleric chooses to focus on two of his deity's domains.

Their mundane and ki-based abilities grow with experience, granting them more power over themselves and their environment.

She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition, over time a wizard learns to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way.

Instead of training and discipline, barbarians have a powerful rage that makes them stronger, tougher, and better able to withstand attacks.

Rogues also seem to have a sixth sense when it comes to avoiding danger. Experienced rogues develop nearly magical powers and skills as they master the arts of stealth, evasion, and sneak attacks.

They have no books, no mentors, no theories just raw power that they direct at will. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire them more slowly, but they can cast individual spells more often and have no need to prepare their incantations ahead of time. Also unlike wizards, sorcerers cannot specialize in a school of magic. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they have more time to learn fighting skills and are proficient with simple weapons.

A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a fey prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity - beings not typically served by clerics.

Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that he can actually draw on natural power to cast divine spells, much as a druid does, and like a druid he is often accompanied by animal companions.

The paladin can also direct this power to help others, healing wounds or curing diseases, and also use it to destroy evil. Experienced paladins can smite evil foes and turn away undead.

Likewise, all clerics have authority over undead creatures, and they can turn away or even destroy these creatures. Clerics are trained in the use of simple weapons, and can use all forms of armor and shields without penalty, since armor does not interfere with the casting of divine spells. In addition to his normal complement of spells, every cleric chooses to focus on two of his deity's domains.

This energy allows them to perform amazing feats, such as healing themselves, catching arrows in flight, and dodging blows with lightning speed. Their mundane and ki-based abilities grow with experience, granting them more power over themselves and their environment.

She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition, over time a wizard learns to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way.

While not equal to a fighter in combat, a rogue knows how to hit where it hurts, and a sneak attack can dish out a lot of damage. Rogues also seem to have a sixth sense when it comes to avoiding danger. Experienced rogues develop nearly magical powers and skills as they master the arts of stealth, evasion, and sneak attacks.

Also unlike wizards, sorcerers cannot specialize in a school of magic.

<div id="directions" title="Directions">
<p>This survey will determine your ability scores, fantasy race, class, alignment, and character level describing what you would be if you were transformed into a Dungeons and Dragons character. This is a long survey, so set aside about 15 to 20 minutes to complete all 140 questions.  Each question should be answered as accurately as possible by choosing the answer that either describes you the best or the answer with which you agree the most.  The answers have been placed in random order, so read carefully. You must answer every question to get the best possible result.  Given the range of ability scores and the number of race, class, alignment, and character level combinations, this survey can produce over 1.5 TRILLION different results.</p>
<p>
Once you have finished answering all of the questions, submit your responses using the button at the bottom of this page.  The results page will display all of your basic character information and the details of your alignment, race, and class.  Also, HTML code that can be used to display the results on your own site and a detailed breakdown of your scores in various categories will be shown if you leave the option boxes checked.  
<!--
You will also have an option to post your results to the Hall of Heroes.  Please finish the process by posting your results so that I can keep track of how this survey is performing.  You'll have to type in a "fantasy name" to go with your character's stats, so think about your name while you complete the survey below.
-->
</p>
<p>
I am happy to announce that the <b><font color="red">WARLOCK</font></b> has been added as a possible class result to the survey!

The Hall of Heroes is now closed to new heroes.  There is no longer an option on the results page to post your hero.  The Waiting Room only has room for fifty heroes, and with the traffic this site now experiences, updating the Hall of Heroes has become an enormous task.  I'd like to thank all of you that posted your results to the Hall of Heroes.  
Information from over one thousand heroes has been entered into a database.

Also, please visit my site on <a href="http://easydamus.com/alignment.html"> The Alignment System</a> where I've compiled alignment information from the first three editions of Dungeons and Dragons, Dragon magazine articles, and other games.

<p> A big thanks to <b>Jacob Z.</b> who requested that I alter the site so that users can answer blocks of questions (and leave other sections blank).  I've gone through the survey and fixed the glitch that "filled in" answers that were left blank.  Now, if you don't want to answer all 140 questions, you can just answer the ones you want and see what you get!
